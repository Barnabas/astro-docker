# Astro + Docker demo

This demonstrates developing with Astro in Docker, using Docker Compose.
It is based on [Astro Starter Kit: Minimal](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/minimal)

To start the stack, run the command `docker compose up --build`.

When you're finished, run `docker compose rm --stop --volumes --force` to clean up.
